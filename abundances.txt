The table corresponds to the Table C.4 in the paper.
Abundances are dimensionless quantities, they have no units. The same happens with their uncertainties.
For H2S, H233S, OCS, OC33S and OC34S, a value and an uncertainty was given. For SO and SO2, a range of values (denoted by XX_min and XX_max) is given, following the results from ArturDeLaVillarmois et al. (2023).
